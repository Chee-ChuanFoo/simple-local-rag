    "### Embedding our text chunks\n",
    "\n",
    "While humans understand text, machines understand numbers best.\n",
    "\n",
    "An [embedding](https://vickiboykis.com/what_are_embeddings/index.html) is a broad concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "But one of my favourite and simple definitions is \"a useful numerical representation\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The most powerful thing about modern embeddings is that they are *learned* representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meaning rather than directly mapping words/tokens/characters to numbers directly (e.g. `{\"a\": 0, \"b\": 1, \"c\": 3...}`), the numerical representation of tokens is learned by going through large corpuses of text and figuring out how different tokens relate to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, embeddings of text will mean that similar meaning texts have similar numerical representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** Most modern NLP models deal with \"tokens\" which can be considered as multiple different sizes and combinations of words and characters rather than always whole words or single characters. For example, the string `\"hello world!\"` gets mapped to the token values `{15339: b'hello', 1917: b' world', 0: b'!'}` using [Byte pair encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_pair_encoding) (or BPE via OpenAI's [`tiktoken`](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) library). Google has a tokenization library called [SentencePiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to turn each of our chunks into a numerical representation (an embedding vector, where a vector is a sequence of numbers arranged in order).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once our text samples are in embedding vectors, us humans will no longer be able to understand them.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we don't need to.\n",
    "\n",
    "The embedding vectors are for our computers to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use our computers to find patterns in the embeddings and then we can use their text mappings to further our understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enough talking, how about we import a text embedding model and see what an embedding looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, we'll use the [`sentence-transformers`](https://www.sbert.net/docs/installation.html) library which contains many pre-trained embedding models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we'll get the `all-mpnet-base-v2` model (you can see the model's intended use on the [Hugging Face model card](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2#intended-uses))."

Nutrients are substances \\nrequired by the body to perform its basic functions. Nutrients must \\nbe obtained from our diet, since the human body does not \\nsynthesize or produce them. Nutrients have one or more of three \\nbasic functions: they provide energy, contribute to body structure, \\nand/or regulate chemical processes in the body. These basic \\nfunctions allow us to detect and respond to environmental \\nsurroundings, move, excrete wastes, respire (breathe), grow, and \\nreproduce. There are six classes of nutrients required for the body \\nto function and maintain overall health. These are carbohydrates, \\nlipids, proteins, water, vitamins, and minerals. Foods also contain \\nnon-nutrients that may be harmful (such as natural toxins common \\nin plant foods and additives like some dyes and preservatives) or \\nbeneficial (such as antioxidants).\\n4 | Introduction',\n",
       " 'Macronutrients \\nNutrients \\nthat \\nare \\nneeded \\nin \\nlarge \\namounts \\nare \\ncalled \\nmacronutrients. There are three classes of macronutrients: \\ncarbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. These can be metabolically \\nprocessed into cellular energy. The energy from macronutrients \\ncomes from their chemical bonds. This chemical energy is \\nconverted into cellular energy that is then utilized to perform work, \\nallowing our bodies to conduct their basic functions. A unit of \\nmeasurement of food energy is the calorie. On nutrition food labels \\nthe amount given for “calories” is actually equivalent to each calorie \\nmultiplied by one thousand. A kilocalorie (one thousand calories, \\ndenoted with a small “c”) is synonymous with the “Calorie” (with a \\ncapital “C”) on nutrition food labels. Water is also a macronutrient in \\nthe sense that you require a large amount of it, but unlike the other \\nmacronutrients, it does not yield calories.\\nCarbohydrates \\nCarbohydrates are molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, and \\noxygen.',\n",
       " 'The major food sources of carbohydrates are grains, milk, \\nfruits, and starchy vegetables, like potatoes. Non-starchy vegetables \\nalso contain carbohydrates, but in lesser quantities. Carbohydrates \\nare broadly classified into two forms based on their chemical \\nstructure: simple carbohydrates, often called simple sugars; and \\ncomplex carbohydrates.\\nSimple carbohydrates consist of one or two basic units. Examples \\nof simple sugars include sucrose, the type of sugar you would have \\nin a bowl on the breakfast table, and glucose, the type of sugar that \\ncirculates in your blood.\\nComplex carbohydrates are long chains of simple sugars that can \\nbe unbranched or branched. During digestion, the body breaks \\nIntroduction | 5',\n",
       " 'down digestible complex carbohydrates to simple sugars, mostly \\nglucose. Glucose is then transported to all our cells where it is \\nstored, used to make energy, or used to build macromolecules. Fiber \\nis also a complex carbohydrate, but it cannot be broken down by \\ndigestive enzymes in the human intestine. As a result, it passes \\nthrough the digestive tract undigested unless the bacteria that \\ninhabit the colon or large intestine break it down.\\nOne gram of digestible carbohydrates yields four kilocalories of \\nenergy for the cells in the body to perform work. In addition to \\nproviding energy and serving as building blocks for bigger \\nmacromolecules, carbohydrates are essential for proper functioning \\nof the nervous system, heart, and kidneys. As mentioned, glucose \\ncan be stored in the body for future use. In humans, the storage \\nmolecule of carbohydrates is called glycogen, and in plants, it is \\nknown as starch. Glycogen and starch are complex carbohydrates.\\nLipids \\nLipids are also a family of molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, \\nand oxygen, but unlike carbohydrates, they are insoluble in water.',\n",
       " 'Lipids are found predominantly in butter, oils, meats, dairy \\nproducts, nuts, and seeds, and in many processed foods. The three \\nmain \\ntypes \\nof \\nlipids \\nare \\ntriglycerides \\n(triacylglycerols), \\nphospholipids, and sterols. The main job of lipids is to provide or \\nstore energy. Lipids provide more energy per gram than \\ncarbohydrates (nine kilocalories per gram of lipids versus four \\nkilocalories per gram of carbohydrates). In addition to energy \\nstorage, lipids serve as a major component of cell membranes, \\nsurround and protect organs (in fat-storing tissues), provide \\ninsulation to aid in temperature regulation, and regulate many other \\nfunctions in the body.\\n6 | Introduction',\n",
       " 'Figure 1.1 The \\nMacronutrie\\nnts: \\nCarbohydrat\\nes, Lipids, \\nProtein, and \\nWater \\nProteins \\nProteins are macromolecules composed of chains of subunits called \\namino acids. Amino acids are simple subunits composed of carbon, \\noxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen. Food sources of proteins include \\nmeats, dairy products, seafood, and a variety of different plant-\\nbased foods, most notably soy. The word protein comes from a \\nGreek word meaning “of primary importance,” which is an apt \\ndescription of these macronutrients; they are also known \\ncolloquially as the “workhorses” of life. Proteins provide four \\nkilocalories of energy per gram; however providing energy is not \\nprotein’s most important function. Proteins provide structure to \\nbones, muscles and skin, and play a role in conducting most of the \\nchemical reactions that take place in the body. Scientists estimate \\nthat greater than one-hundred thousand different proteins exist \\nwithin the human body. The genetic codes in DNA are basically \\nprotein recipes that determine the order in which 20 different \\namino acids are bound together to make thousands of specific \\nproteins.\\nFigure 1.1 The Macronutrients: Carbohydrates, Lipids, Protein, and \\nWater \\nIntroduction | 7',\n",
       " 'Water \\nThere is one other nutrient that we must have in large quantities: \\nwater. Water does not contain carbon, but is composed of two \\nhydrogens and one oxygen per molecule of water. More than 60 \\npercent of your total body weight is water. Without it, nothing could \\nbe transported in or out of the body, chemical reactions would not \\noccur, organs would not be cushioned, and body temperature would \\nfluctuate widely. On average, an adult consumes just over two liters \\nof water per day from food and drink combined. Since water is so \\ncritical for life’s basic processes, the amount of water input and \\noutput is supremely important, a topic we will explore in detail in \\nChapter 4.\\nMicronutrients \\nMicronutrients are nutrients required by the body in lesser \\namounts, but are still essential for carrying out bodily functions.\\nMicronutrients include all the essential minerals and vitamins.\\nThere are sixteen essential minerals and thirteen vitamins (See \\nTable 1.1 “Minerals and Their Major Functions” and Table 1.2 \\n“Vitamins and Their Major Functions” for a complete list and their \\nmajor functions).

       " 'Achieving a Healthy Diet \\nUNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I AT MĀNOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN \\nNUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM \\nAchieving a healthy diet is a matter of balancing the quality and \\nquantity of food that is eaten. There are five key factors that make \\nup a healthful diet: \\n1. A diet must be adequate, by providing sufficient amounts of \\neach essential nutrient, as well as fiber and adequate calories.\\n2. A balanced diet results when you do not consume one nutrient \\nat the expense of another, but rather get appropriate amounts \\nof all nutrients.\\n3. Calorie control is necessary so that the amount of energy you \\nget from the nutrients you consume equals the amount of \\nenergy you expend during your day’s activities.\\n4. Moderation means not eating to the extremes, neither too \\nmuch nor too little.\\n5.',\n",
       " 'Variety refers to consuming different foods from within each \\nof the food groups on a regular basis.\\nA healthy diet is one that favors whole foods. As an alternative \\nto modern processed foods, a healthy diet focuses on “real” fresh \\nwhole foods that have been sustaining people for generations.\\nWhole foods supply the needed vitamins, minerals, protein, \\ncarbohydrates, fats, and fiber that are essential to good health.\\nCommercially prepared and fast foods are often lacking nutrients \\nand often contain inordinate amounts of sugar, salt, saturated and \\ntrans fats, all of which are associated with the development of \\ndiseases such as atherosclerosis, heart disease, stroke, cancer, \\nobesity, diabetes, and other illnesses. A balanced diet is a mix of food \\nfrom the different food groups (vegetables, legumes, fruits, grains, \\nprotein foods, and dairy).\\n30 | Achieving a Healthy Diet',\n",
       " 'Adequacy \\nAn adequate diet is one that favors nutrient-dense foods. Nutrient-\\ndense foods are defined as foods that contain many essential \\nnutrients per calorie. Nutrient-dense foods are the opposite of \\n“empty-calorie” foods, such as sugary carbonated beverages, which \\nare also called “nutrient-poor.”Nutrient-dense foods include fruits \\nand vegetables, lean meats, poultry, fish, low-fat dairy products, and \\nwhole grains. Choosing more nutrient-dense foods will facilitate \\nweight loss, while simultaneously providing all necessary nutrients.\\nBalance \\nBalance the foods in your diet. Achieving balance in your diet entails \\nnot consuming one nutrient at the expense of another. For example, \\ncalcium is essential for healthy teeth and bones, but too much \\ncalcium will interfere with iron absorption. Most foods that are \\ngood sources of iron are poor sources of calcium, so in order to \\nget the necessary amounts of calcium and iron from your diet, a \\nproper balance between food choices is critical. Another example \\nis that while sodium is an essential nutrient, excessive intake may \\ncontribute to congestive heart failure and chronic kidney disease \\nin some people.',\n",
       " 'Remember, everything must be consumed in the \\nproper amounts.\\nModeration \\nEat in moderation. Moderation is crucial for optimal health and \\nsurvival. Eating nutrient-poor foods each night for dinner will lead \\nto health complications. But as part of an otherwise healthful diet \\nand consumed only on a weekly basis, this should not significantly \\nAchieving a Healthy Diet | 31',\n",
       " 'impact overall health. It’s important to remember that eating is, in \\npart, about enjoyment and indulging with a spirit of moderation.\\nThis fits within a healthy diet.\\nMonitor food portions. For optimum weight maintenance, it is \\nimportant to ensure that energy consumed from foods meets the \\nenergy expenditures required for body functions and activity. If not, \\nthe excess energy contributes to gradual, steady accumulation of \\nstored body fat and weight gain. In order to lose body fat, you need \\nto ensure that more calories are burned than consumed. Likewise, \\nin order to gain weight, calories must be eaten in excess of what is \\nexpended daily.\\nVariety \\nVariety involves eating different foods from all the food groups.\\nEating a varied diet helps to ensure that you consume and absorb \\nadequate amounts of all essential nutrients required for health.',\n",
       " 'One \\nof the major drawbacks of a monotonous diet is the risk of \\nconsuming too much of some nutrients and not enough of others.\\nTrying new foods can also be a source of pleasure—you never know \\nwhat foods you might like until you try them.\\nDeveloping a healthful diet can be rewarding, but be mindful that \\nall of the principles presented must be followed to derive maximal \\nhealth benefits. For instance, introducing variety in your diet can \\nstill result in the consumption of too many high-calorie, nutrient \\npoor foods and inadequate nutrient intake if you do not also employ \\nmoderation and calorie control. Using all of these principles \\ntogether will promote lasting health benefits.\\n32 | Achieving a Healthy Diet',\n",

The first step is ingestion, which is the \\nintake of food into the digestive tract. It may seem a simple process, \\nbut ingestion involves smelling food, thinking about food, and the \\ninvoluntary release of saliva in the mouth to prepare for food entry.\\nIn the mouth, where the second step of digestion starts, the \\nmechanical and chemical breakdown of food begins.

Teeth crush and grind large food particles, while saliva \\nprovides lubrication and enables food movement downward. The \\nslippery mass of partially broken-down food is called a bolus, which \\nmoves down the digestive tract as you swallow. Swallowing may \\nseem voluntary at first because it requires conscious effort to push \\nthe food with the tongue back toward the throat, but after this, \\nswallowing proceeds involuntarily, meaning it cannot be stopped \\n72 | The Digestive System',\n",
       " 'Image by \\nAllison \\nCalabrese / \\nCC BY 4.0 \\nonce it begins. As you swallow, the bolus is pushed from the mouth \\nthrough the pharynx and into a muscular tube called the esophagus.\\nAs the bolus travels through the pharynx, a small flap called the \\nepiglottis closes to prevent choking by keeping food from going \\ninto the trachea. Peristaltic contractions also known as peristalsis in \\nthe esophagus propel the food bolus down to the stomach (Figure \\n3.6 “Peristalsis in the Esophagus”). At the junction between the \\nesophagus and stomach there is a sphincter muscle that remains \\nclosed until the food bolus approaches. The pressure of the food \\nbolus stimulates the lower esophageal sphincter to relax and open \\nand food then moves from the esophagus into the stomach. The \\nmechanical breakdown of food is accentuated by the muscular \\ncontractions of the stomach and small intestine that mash, mix, \\nslosh, and propel food down the alimentary canal. Solid food takes \\nbetween four and eight seconds to travel down the esophagus, and \\nliquids take about one second.\\nFigure 2.6 Peristalsis in the Esophagus \\nThe Digestive System | 73',\n",
       " 'From the Stomach to the Small Intestine \\nWhen food enters the stomach, a highly muscular organ, powerful \\nperistaltic contractions help mash, pulverize, and churn food into \\nchyme. Chyme is a semiliquid mass of partially digested food that \\nalso contains gastric juices secreted by cells in the stomach. These \\ngastric juices contain hydrochloric acid and the enzyme pepsin, that \\nchemically start breakdown of the protein components of food.\\nThe length of time food spends in the stomach varies by the \\nmacronutrient composition of the meal. A high-fat or high-protein \\nmeal takes longer to break down than one rich in carbohydrates.\\nIt usually takes a few hours after a meal to empty the stomach \\ncontents completely into the small intestine.\\nThe small intestine is divided into three structural parts: the \\nduodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum. Once the chyme enters the \\nduodenum (the first segment of the small intestine), the pancreas \\nand gallbladder are stimulated and release juices that aid in \\ndigestion. The pancreas secretes up to 1.5 liters (.4 US gallons) of \\npancreatic juice through a duct into the duodenum per day. This \\nfluid consists mostly of water, but it also contains bicarbonate ions \\nthat neutralize the acidity of the stomach-derived chyme and \\nenzymes that further break down proteins, carbohydrates, and \\nlipids.',\n",

Almost \\nall the components of food are completely broken down to their \\nsimplest units within the first 25 centimeters of the small intestine.\\nInstead of proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids, the chyme now \\nconsists of amino acids, monosaccharides, and emulsified \\ncomponents of triglycerides.\\nFigure 2.7 Segmentation \\nThe third step of digestion (nutrient absorption) takes place mainly \\nin the remaining length of the small intestine, or ileum (> 5 meters).\\nThe way the small intestine is structured gives it a huge surface \\nThe Digestive System | 75',\n",

A main task of the large intestine is to absorb much of the \\nremaining water. Remember, water is present not only in solid foods \\nand beverages, but also the stomach releases a few hundred \\nmilliliters of gastric juice, and the pancreas adds approximately 500 \\nmilliliters during the digestion of the meal. For the body to conserve \\nwater, it is important that excessive water is not lost in fecal matter.\\nIn the large intestine, no further chemical or mechanical breakdown \\nof food takes place unless it is accomplished by the bacteria that \\ninhabit this portion of the intestinal tract. The number of bacteria \\nresiding in the large intestine is estimated to be greater than 1014, \\nwhich is more than the total number of cells in the human body \\n(1013). This may seem rather unpleasant, but the great majority \\nof bacteria in the large intestine are harmless and many are even \\nbeneficial.\\nFrom the Large Intestine to the Anus \\nAfter a few hours in the stomach, plus three to six hours in the \\nsmall intestine, and about sixteen hours in the large intestine, the \\ndigestion process enters step four, which is the elimination of \\nindigestible food matter as feces.

The \\nconcentration is the amount of particles in a set volume of water.\\n(Recall that individual solutes can differ in concentration between \\nthe intracellular and extracellular fluids, but the total concentration \\nof all dissolved substances is equal.)\\nThe force driving the water movement through the selectively \\npermeable membrane is the higher solute concentration on the \\none side. Solutes at different concentrations on either side of a \\nselectively permeable membrane exert a force, called osmotic \\npressure. The higher concentration of solutes on one side compared \\nto the other of the U-tube exerts osmotic pressure, pulling the \\nwater to a higher volume on the side of the U-tube containing \\nmore dissolved particles. When the osmotic pressure is equal to the \\npressure of the water on the selectively permeable membrane, net \\nwater movement stops (though it still diffuses back and forth at an \\nequal rate).\\nOne equation exemplifying equal concentrations but different \\nvolumes is the following \\n5 grams of glucose in 1 liter = 10 grams of glucose in 2 liters (5g/L = \\n5g/L) \\nThe differences in concentrations of particular substances \\nprovide concentration gradients that cells can use to perform work.',\n",

The cell \\n(or more specifically the numerous sodium-potassium pumps in \\nits membrane) continuously pumps sodium ions out to establish \\na chemical gradient.

Kidney \\nreabsorption of sodium is hormonally controlled, allowing for a \\nrelatively constant sodium concentration in the blood.\\nOther Functions of Sodium in the Body \\nThe second notable function of sodium is in nerve impulse \\ntransmission. Nerve impulse transmission results from the \\ntransport of sodium cations into a nerve cell, which creates a charge \\ndifference (or voltage) between the nerve cell and its extracellular \\nenvironment. Similar to how a current moves along a wire, a sodium \\ncurrent moves along a nerve cell. Stimulating a muscle contraction \\nalso involves the movement of sodium ions as well as other ion \\nmovements.\\nSodium is essential for nutrient absorption in the small intestine \\nand also for nutrient reabsorption in the kidney.

They are energy production, energy storage, building \\nmacromolecules, sparing protein, and assisting in lipid metabolism.\\nEnergy Production \\nThe primary role of carbohydrates is to supply energy to all cells \\nin the body. Many cells prefer glucose as a source of energy versus \\nother compounds like fatty acids. Some cells, such as red blood \\ncells, are only able to produce cellular energy from glucose. The \\nbrain is also highly sensitive to low blood-glucose levels because \\nit uses only glucose to produce energy and function (unless under \\nextreme starvation conditions). About 70 percent of the glucose \\nentering the body from digestion is redistributed (by the liver) back \\ninto the blood for use by other tissues. Cells that require energy \\nremove the glucose from the blood with a transport protein in their \\nmembranes. The energy from glucose comes from the chemical \\nbonds between the carbon atoms. Sunlight energy was required to \\nproduce these high-energy bonds in the process of photosynthesis.',\n",
       " 'Cells in our bodies break these bonds and capture the energy to \\nperform cellular respiration. Cellular respiration is basically a \\ncontrolled burning of glucose versus an uncontrolled burning. A cell \\nuses many chemical reactions in multiple enzymatic steps to slow \\nthe release of energy (no explosion) and more efficiently capture the \\nenergy held within the chemical bonds in glucose.\\nThe Functions of Carbohydrates in\\nthe Body | 253',\n",

The energy from these carbon \\nbonds is carried to another area of the mitochondria, making the \\ncellular energy available in a form cells can use.\\nFigure 4.10 Cellular Respiration \\n \\nCellular respiration is the process by which energy is captured from \\nglucose.\\nEnergy Storage \\nIf the body already has enough energy to support its functions, the \\nexcess glucose is stored as glycogen (the majority of which is stored \\nin the muscles and liver).

The differences in chemical structure between the \\ndifferent carbohydrates confer their varied functional uses in foods.\\nStarches, gums, and pectins are used as thickening agents in making \\njam, cakes, cookies, noodles, canned products, imitation cheeses, \\nand a variety of other foods. Molecular gastronomists use slow-\\nreleasing carbohydrates, such as alginate, to give shape and texture \\nto their fascinating food creations. Adding fiber to foods increases \\nbulk. Simple sugars are used not only for adding sweetness, but \\nalso to add texture, consistency, and browning. In ice cream, the \\ncombination of sucrose and corn syrup imparts sweetness as well as \\na glossy appearance and smooth texture.',\n",

Sugar substitutes may be from natural sources or \\nartificially made. Those that are artificially made are called artificial \\nsweeteners and must be approved by the FDA for use in foods \\nand beverages. The artificial sweeteners approved by the FDA are \\nsaccharin, aspartame, acesulfame potassium, neotame, advantame, \\nand sucralose. Stevia is an example of a naturally derived sugar \\nsubstitute.

The FDA requires that foods disclose the fact that \\nthey contain sugar alcohols, but does not require scientific testing \\nof it. (Though many of them have undergone studies anyway.)In \\ncomparison to sucrose, artificial sweeteners are significantly \\nsweeter (in fact, by several hundred times), but sugar alcohols are \\nmore often less sweet than sucrose (see Table 4.5 “Relative \\nSweetness of Sugar Substitutes”). Artificial sweeteners and Stevia \\nare not digested or absorbed in significant amounts and therefore \\nare not a significant source of calories in the diet.

While glycogen provides a ready source of \\nenergy, lipids primarily function as an energy reserve. As you may \\nrecall, glycogen is quite bulky with heavy water content, thus the \\nbody cannot store too much for long. Alternatively, fats are packed \\ntogether tightly without water and store far greater amounts of \\nenergy in a reduced space. A fat gram is densely concentrated with \\nenergy—it contains more than double the amount of energy than a \\ngram of carbohydrate.

The \\nRDAs for protein were determined by assessing nitrogen balance.\\nNitrogen is one of the four basic elements contained in all amino \\nacids. When proteins are broken down and amino acids are \\ncatabolized, nitrogen is released. Remember that when the liver \\nbreaks down amino acids, it produces ammonia, which is rapidly \\nconverted to nontoxic, nitrogen-containing urea, which is then \\ntransported to the kidneys for excretion.',\n",
       " 'Most nitrogen is lost as \\nurea in the urine, but urea is also excreted in the feces. Proteins are \\nalso lost in sweat and as hair and nails grow. The RDA, therefore, \\nis the amount of protein a person should consume in their diet to \\nbalance the amount of protein used up and lost from the body. For \\nhealthy adults, this amount of protein was determined to be 0.8 \\ngrams of protein per kilogram of body weight. You can calculate \\n410 | Proteins, Diet, and Personal Choices',\n",

A person is said to be in nitrogen balance when the \\nnitrogen input equals the amount of nitrogen used and excreted. A \\nperson is in negative nitrogen balance when the amount of excreted \\nnitrogen is greater than that consumed, meaning that the body is \\nbreaking down more protein to meet its demands. This state of \\nimbalance can occur in people who have certain diseases, such \\nas cancer or muscular dystrophy. Someone who has a low-protein \\ndiet may also be in negative nitrogen balance as they are taking in \\nless protein than what they actually need. Positive nitrogen balance \\noccurs when a person excretes less nitrogen than what is taken \\nin by the diet, such as during child growth or pregnancy. At these \\ntimes the body requires more protein to build new tissues, so more \\nof what gets consumed gets used up and less nitrogen is excreted. A \\nperson healing from a severe wound may also be in positive nitrogen \\nbalance because protein is being used up to repair tissues.',\n",

Multiple studies show high intakes of hard \\nliquor are linked to weight gain, although this may be the result \\nof the regular consumption of hard liquor with sugary soft drinks, \\njuices, and other mixers. On the other hand drinking beer and, even \\nmore so, red wine, is not consistently linked to weight gain and \\nin some studies actually decreases weight gain. The contradictory \\nresults of scientific studies that have examined the association of \\nalcohol intake with body weight are partly due to the fact that \\nalcohol contributes calories to the diet.

This potential energy is \\nconverted into kinetic energy in the body that drives many body \\nfunctions ranging from muscle and nerve function to driving the \\nsynthesis of body protein for growth.

The structural \\nelements of an atom are protons (positively charged), neutrons (no \\ncharge), and electrons (negatively charged). Protons and neutrons \\nare contained in the dense nucleus of the atom; the nucleus thus has \\na positive charge. Because opposites attract, electrons are attracted \\nto this nucleus and move around it in the electron cloud.\\nElectrons contain energy, and this energy is stored within the \\ncharge and movement of electrons and the bonds atoms make with \\none another. However, this energy is not always stable, depending \\non the number of electrons within an atom. Atoms are more stable \\nwhen their electrons orbit in pairs. An atom with an odd number \\nof electrons must have an unpaired electron. In most cases, these \\nunpaired electrons are used to create chemical bonds. A chemical \\nbond is the attractive force between atoms and contains potential \\nenergy.',\n",
       " 'By bonding, electrons find pairs and chemicals become part \\nof a molecule.\\nBond formation and bond breaking are chemical reactions that \\ninvolve the movement of electrons between atoms. These chemical \\nreactions occur continuously in the body. We previously reviewed \\nhow glucose breaks down into water and carbon dioxide as part of \\ncellular respiration. The energy released by breaking those bonds \\nis used to form molecules of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Recall \\nhow during this process electrons are extracted from glucose in a \\nstepwise manner and transferred to other molecules. Occasionally \\nelectrons “escape” and, instead of completing the cellular \\nrespiration cycle, are transferred to an oxygen molecule.

The fatty acid then becomes a free \\nradical that can react with another fatty acid nearby. As this chain \\nreaction continues, the permeability and fluidity of cell membranes \\nchanges, proteins in cell membranes experience decreased activity, \\nand receptor proteins undergo changes in structure that either alter \\nor stop their function.

Generally, catabolic processes release energy and \\nanabolic processes consume energy. The overall goals of \\nmetabolism are energy transfer and matter transport.

Metabolism transforms the matter \\nof macronutrients into substances a cell can use to grow and \\nreproduce and also into waste products. For example, enzymes are \\nproteins and their job is to catalyze chemical reactions. Catalyze \\nmeans to speed-up a chemical reaction and reduce the energy \\nrequired to complete the chemical reaction, without the catalyst \\nbeing used up in the reaction. Without enzymes, chemical reactions \\nwould not happen at a fast enough rate and would use up too \\nmuch energy for life to exist.

       " 'Fat-Soluble Vitamins \\nUNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I AT MĀNOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN \\nNUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM \\nVitamin A Functions and Health Benefits \\nVitamin A is a generic term for a group of similar compounds called \\nretinoids. Retinol is the form of vitamin A found in animal-derived \\nfoods, and is converted in the body to the biologically active forms \\nof vitamin A: retinal and retinoic acid (thus retinol is sometimes \\nreferred to as “preformed vitamin A”). About 10 percent of plant-\\nderived carotenoids, including beta-carotene, can be converted in \\nthe body to retinoids and are another source of functional vitamin \\nA. Carotenoids are pigments synthesized by plants that give them \\ntheir yellow, orange, and red color. Over six hundred carotenoids \\nhave been identified and, with just a few exceptions, all are found \\nin the plant kingdom. There are two classes of carotenoids—the \\nxanthophylls, which contain oxygen, and the carotenes, which do \\nnot.\\nIn plants, carotenoids absorb light for use in photosynthesis and \\nact as antioxidants. Beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, and beta-\\ncryptoxanthin are converted to some extent to retinol in the body.\\nThe other carotenoids, such as lycopene, are not. Many biological \\nactions of carotenoids are attributed to their antioxidant activity, \\nbut they likely act by other mechanisms, too.\\nVitamin A is fat-soluble and is packaged into chylomicrons in \\nsmall intestine, and transported to the liver.',\n",
       " 'The liver stores and \\nexports vitamin A as needed; it is released into the blood bound to a \\nretinol-binding protein, which transports it to cells. Carotenoids are \\nnot absorbed as well as vitamin A, but similar to vitamin A, they do \\nrequire fat in the meal for absorption. In intestinal cells, carotenoids \\nFat-Soluble Vitamins | 521',\n",
       " 'are packaged into the lipid-containing chylomicrons inside small \\nintestine mucosal cells and then transported to the liver. In the liver, \\ncarotenoids are repackaged into lipoproteins, which transport them \\nto cells.\\nThe retinoids are aptly named as their most notable function is \\nin the retina of the eye where they aid in vision, particularly in \\nseeing under low-light conditions. This is why night blindness is the \\nmost definitive sign of vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A has several \\nimportant functions in the body, including maintaining vision and a \\nhealthy immune system. Many of vitamin A’s functions in the body \\nare similar to the functions of hormones (for example, vitamin A can \\ninteract with DNA, causing a change in protein function). Vitamin A \\nassists in maintaining healthy skin and the linings and coverings of \\ntissues; it also regulates growth and development. As an antioxidant, \\nvitamin A protects cellular membranes, helps in maintaining \\nglutathione levels, and influences the amount and activity of \\nenzymes that detoxify free radicals.\\nVision \\nRetinol that is circulating in the blood is taken up by cells in the \\neye retina, where it is converted to retinal and is used to help \\nthe pigment rhodopsin, which is involved in the eye’s ability to see \\nunder low light conditions. A deficiency in vitamin A thus results in \\nless rhodopsin and a decrease in the detection of low-level light, a \\ncondition referred to as night-blindness.',\n",
       " 'Insufficient intake of dietary vitamin A over time can also cause \\ncomplete vision loss. In fact, vitamin A deficiency is the number \\none cause of preventable blindness worldwide.

In Asia in the late 1980s, \\ntargeted populations of children were administered vitamin A \\nsupplements, and the death rates from measles and diarrhea \\ndeclined by up to 50 percent. Vitamin A supplementation in these \\ndeficient populations did not reduce the number of children who \\ncontracted these diseases, but it did decrease the severity of the \\ndiseases so that they were no longer fatal. Soon after the results \\nof these studies were communicated to the rest of the world, the \\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations \\nChildren’s Fund (UNICEF) commenced worldwide campaigns \\nagainst vitamin A deficiency. UNICEF estimates that the distribution \\nof over half a billion vitamin A capsules prevents 350,000 childhood \\ndeaths annually.1 \\nIn the twenty-first century, science has demonstrated that \\nvitamin A greatly affects the immune system. What we are still \\nlacking are clinical trials investigating the proper doses of vitamin \\nA required to help ward off infectious disease and how large of \\nan effect vitamin A supplementation has on populations that are \\nnot deficient in this vitamin. This brings up one of our common \\nthemes in this text—micronutrient deficiencies may contribute to \\nthe development, progression, and severity of a disease, but this \\ndoes not mean that an increased intake of these micronutrients will \\nsolely prevent or cure disease.

Vitamin K is critical for blood function acting \\nas coenzymes which play an essential role in blood coagulation (aka \\nblood clotting). Blood-clotting proteins are continuously circulating \\nin the blood. Upon injury to a blood vessel, platelets stick to the \\nwound forming a plug. Without vitamin K, blood would not clot.\\nA deficiency in vitamin K causes bleeding disorders. It is relatively \\nrare, but people who have liver or pancreatic disease, celiac disease, \\nor malabsorption conditions are at higher risk for vitamin K \\ndeficiency.

For \\nexample, the immune system uses the cell-damaging properties of \\nfree radicals to kill pathogens. First, immune cells engulf an invader \\n(such as a bacterium), then they expose it to free radicals such as \\nhydrogen peroxide, which destroys its membrane. The invader is \\nthus neutralized. Scientific studies also suggest hydrogen peroxide \\nacts as a signaling molecule that calls immune cells to injury sites, \\nmeaning free radicals may aid with tissue repair when you get cut.\\nFree radicals are necessary for many other bodily functions as \\nwell. The thyroid gland synthesizes its own hydrogen peroxide, \\nwhich is required for the production of thyroid hormone. Reactive \\noxygen species and reactive nitrogen species, which are free \\nradicals containing nitrogen, have been found to interact with \\nproteins in cells to produce signaling molecules. The free radical \\nnitric oxide has been found to help dilate blood vessels and act as a \\nchemical messenger in the brain. By acting as signaling molecules, \\nfree radicals are involved in the control of their own synthesis, \\nstress responses, regulation of cell growth and death, and \\nmetabolism.',\n",

Excessive exposure to environmental sources of \\nfree radicals can contribute to disease by overwhelming the free \\nradical detoxifying systems and those processes involved in \\nrepairing oxidative damage.\\nOxidative Stress \\nOxidative stress refers to an imbalance in any cell, tissue, or organ \\nbetween the amount of free radicals and the capabilities of the \\ndetoxifying and repair systems. Sustained oxidative damage results \\nonly under conditions of oxidative stress—when the detoxifying and \\nrepair systems are insufficient. Free radical-induced damage, when \\nleft unrepaired, destroys lipids, proteins, RNA, and DNA, and can \\ncontribute to disease.

In the process of aging, tissue \\nfunction declines.

       " 'Calcium \\nUNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I AT MĀNOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN \\nNUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM \\nCalcium’s Functional Roles \\nCalcium is the most abundant mineral in the body and greater than \\n99 percent of it is stored in bone tissue. Although only 1 percent of \\nthe calcium in the human body is found in the blood and soft tissues, \\nit is here that it performs the most critical functions. Blood calcium \\nlevels are rigorously controlled so that if blood levels drop the body \\nwill rapidly respond by stimulating bone resorption, thereby \\nreleasing stored calcium into the blood. Thus, bone tissue sacrifices \\nits stored calcium to maintain blood calcium levels. This is why bone \\nhealth is dependent on the intake of dietary calcium and also why \\nblood levels of calcium do not always correspond to dietary intake.\\nCalcium plays a role in a number of different functions in the \\nbody like bone and tooth formation. The most well-known calcium \\nfunction is to build and strengthen bones and teeth. Recall that \\nwhen bone tissue first forms during the modeling or remodeling \\nprocess, it is unhardened, protein-rich osteoid tissue. In the \\nosteoblast-directed process of bone mineralization, calcium \\nphosphates (salts) are deposited on the protein matrix. The calcium \\nsalts typically make up about 65 percent of bone tissue.',\n",
       " 'When your \\ndiet is calcium deficient, the mineral content of bone decreases \\ncausing it to become brittle and weak. Thus, increased calcium \\nintake helps to increase the mineralized content of bone tissue.\\nGreater mineralized bone tissue corresponds to a greater BMD, \\nand to greater bone strength. The remaining calcium plays a role \\nin nerve impulse transmission by facilitating electrical impulse \\ntransmission from one nerve cell to another. Calcium in muscle cells \\nCalcium | 613',\n",
       " 'is essential for muscle contraction because the flow of calcium ions \\nare needed for the muscle proteins (actin and myosin) to interact.\\nCalcium is also essential in blood clotting by activating clotting \\nfactors to fix damaged tissue.\\nIn addition to calcium’s four primary functions calcium has \\nseveral other minor functions that are also critical for maintaining \\nnormal physiology. For example, without calcium, the hormone \\ninsulin could not be released from cells in the pancreas and \\nglycogen could not be broken down in muscle cells and used to \\nprovide energy for muscle contraction.\\nMaintaining Calcium Levels \\nBecause calcium performs such vital functions in the body, blood \\ncalcium level is closely regulated by the hormones parathyroid \\nhormone (PTH), calcitriol, and calcitonin. When blood calcium levels \\nare low, PTH is secreted to increase blood calcium levels via three \\ndifferent mechanisms. First, PTH stimulates the release of calcium \\nstored in the bone. Second, PTH acts on kidney cells to increase \\ncalcium reabsorption and decrease its excretion in the urine. Third, \\nPTH stimulates enzymes in the kidney that activate vitamin D to \\ncalcitriol. Calcitriol is the active hormone that acts on the intestinal \\ncells and increases dietary calcium absorption.',\n",

The doses of fluoride used to treat osteoporosis are much \\ngreater than that in fluoridated water.\\n696 | Fluoride',\n",

    "> **What other forms of text chunking/splitting are there?**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a fair few options here too. We've kept it simple with groups of sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more, [Pinecone has a great guide on different kinds of chunking](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/chunking-strategies/) including for different kinds of data such as markdown and LaTeX.\n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries such as [LangChain also have a good amount of in-built text splitting options](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/).\n",

    "> **What should I think about when creating my embeddings?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model turns text inputs up to 384 tokens long in embedding vectors of size 768.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, the larger the vector size, the more information that gets encoded into the embedding (however, this is not always the case, as smaller, better models can outperform larger ones).\n",
    "\n",
    "Though with larger vector sizes comes larger storage and compute requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model is also relatively small (420MB) in size compared to larger models that are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Larger models may result in better performance but will also require more compute.\n",
    "\n",
    "So some things to think about:\n",
    "* Size of input - If you need to embed longer sequences, choose a model with a larger input capacity.\n",
    "* Size of embedding vector - Larger is generally a better representation but requires more compute/storage.\n",
    "* Size of model - Larger models generally result in better embeddings but require more compute power/time to run.\n",
    "* Open or closed - Open models allow you to run them on your own hardware whereas closed models can be easier to setup but require an API call to get embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Where should I store my embeddings?**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've got a relatively small dataset, for example, under 100,000 examples (this number is rough and only based on first hand experience), `np.array` or `torch.tensor` can work just fine as your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if you've got a production system and want to work with 100,000+ embeddings, you may want to look into a [vector database]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_database) (these have become very popular lately and there are many offerings).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Document Ingestion and Embedding Creation Extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "One major extension to the workflow above would to functionize it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or turn it into a script.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in, take all the functionality we've created and package it into a single process (e.g. go from document -> embeddings file).\n",
    "\n",
    "So you could input a document on one end and have embeddings come out the other end. The hardest part of this is knowing what kind of preprocessing your text may need before it's turned into embeddings. Cleaner text generally means better results.\n",
